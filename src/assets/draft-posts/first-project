Creating A Blog

text
The blog project is an attempt to go through the motions from a low level to both build a piece of software, deploy it, and create a platform for sharing my existing blog posts. In the past I've added pretty much everything I wanted to write about to https://github.com/dawguy/Blog as unstructured .md files. I wanted to create a blog as a way to help me put these into a structured and hopefully helpful for the world format.
Most of my existing blog posts document the steps I've taken to create hobby projets, and the problem solving I've done encountered while building them.

What's next?

For right now it'll mostly be writing up content that I think is worth sharing. I'm going to continue using my github Blog project as a store of notes, but should be creating posts here soon too.

Also possibly to come are some travel related posts as I'll be doing some travelling this year to other parts of the world.
